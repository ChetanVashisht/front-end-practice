        "description": "A forty year old house in Jayanagar, renovated with an additional floor. The architecture has been tailored to the existing load bearing structure while keeping in mind  the evolving cultural context. The space plays multiple roles, from being a simple one bedroom house to being an entertainment hall. While the wife happens to be a former table tennis player and the husband, a movie buff, the space becomes a shapeshifter from a table tennis coaching centre with apt flooring to a dark movie theatre with perfect vision distance and acoustics."

        "description": "The Farm, is a family farmhouse located on Kanakapura road, about thirty minutes from Bangalore. It is designed to be the perfect weekend getaway for the family. The client also wanted to rent it out for huge parties when they are not using it. Hence, the design wrote itself to be three blocks. One common central block with living, dining and kitchen spaces, one block with bedrooms opening up to the pool, for the crowd that will party and one block with luxurious private bedrooms only for the family’s use, tucked away from the noise.\n The site has a slope down towards the west with a beautiful lake view. The three blocks are placed parallel to each other, with courtyards in between. This creates a channel for the wind flow, allows the diffused light in throughout the day and minimises the exposure to the west sun while retaining the opening to the view. One of the courtyards is designed as a party deck with a pool and the other as a more silent, relaxing one. The language and materials of the building were inspired by modernist and minimalist ideologies."

Two similar two bedroom houses were planned over two floors with good lighting and views into the greenery. A large portico is inculcated on the ground floor to gather all three families. Some english farmhouse elements have been introduced to the otherwise typical Indian design."

The dry bath was separated as a more frequently used space. This allowed for a clean spacious bedroom with a reading nook and a window seating."

A vibrant room with colours has been designed to induce an energetic mood. All walls were used for rope walls or storage, which led us to a mirror cladded ceiling in unison with the aerial hooks. This gives opportunity for each student to view themselves and correct postures. \nThe other room is designed for more calm practices, hence the concept of neutral, earthy tones to bring in the mood. The spaces have been layouted for different practices to smoothly take place simultaneously. A detox kitchen and seating has been designed to be part of the cool down session after each class. Hence, bringing the whole cycle of warm-up to cool down through the spaces."

This creates a flow from the pool to the deck and into the house. While the space is functional for a daily swim and tea party, it doubles up into a perfect spot for entertaining a party."
